            Worked as a software engineering intern on the Presto team,
            which develops a database query engine for distributed systems.
            My work was centred around speeding up Velox, the back-end
            vectorized database acceleration library that handled execution on
            worker nodes, and increasing the efficiency of certain types of row
            filters.

            Currently serving as a head teaching assistant for 15-210 Parallel and
            Sequential Data Structures and Algorithms, the introductory algorithms
            class at CMU. As head TA, I organize the staff and coordinate logistics.
            I also contribute to content development and homework refinement to
            maximize student learning. I also lead recitations of 30+ students.

            <br />
            <br />
            Served as a teaching assistant for 15-122 Principles of Imperative
            Computation, an introductory programming class for first-year CS
            students at CMU. As a TA, I led weekly labs and recitations to teach
            fundamentals of the C programming language to 30+ students, and graded
            over 400 written assignments along with the other TAs every week.

            <h2>University of Washington &#8211; Software Development Intern</h2>
            <p>
            <i class="subtitle">Seattle, WA &#8226; June - August 2019, June - August 2020</i>
            <br />
            <br />
            Interned at the University of Washington Applied Physics Lab for two
            separate summers, working on a team investigating plane-wave ultrasound
            technologies and their uses in neuroscience.
            <br /> <br />
            The first summer, I was tasked with optimizing MATLAB
            code for reconstructing images from raw ultrasound scan data. By
            exploiting parallelism and rewriting parts of the MATLAB script in C, I
            was able to make reconstructions run 20 times faster while maintaining
            the same image quality. I also investigated and built network-attached
            storage systems for storing scan data.
            <br /> <br />
            The second summer, I ran reconstruction scripts on scan data to
            generate images, which were then used in publications by my research
            supervisor. I also created a Python tool which allowed users to click
            on two points within an image and find the velocity of blood flow across
            the blood vessel between them from the scan data.
